## User stories

- I can see a list of existing users
- I can see a list of existing groups
- I can create users
- I can create groups
- I can assign users to a group they arenâ€™t already part of
- I can remove users from a group
- I can delete groups when they no longer have members
- I can delete users
- I can see "group detail page" where it is possible to see a list of all users in a given group
- I can see "user detail page" where it is possible to see a list of all groups ids

Notes: On the `UserDetails` page you will find the ids of the groups, logic for displaying groups names and removing items is very similar to the one in the `GroupDetails` page. See for reference.
